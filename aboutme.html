        <p>New York Times best-selling author of How to Travel the World on $50 a Day and founder of this site. Each month over 1,000,000 people use my advice to travel better, cheaper, and longer. Have you ever thought</p>

      <div class="second">
        <p>“How do I find the money to travel? It seems too expensive for me.”
        “Where do I find good travel deals?”
        “How do I save money on flights, accommodation, and other big expenses?”
        “How do I plan my trip?”
        “How do I stay safe and healthy?”
        “How do I maximize my time?”
        “I want to travel more but I don’t know the first step.”</p>

      </div>

      <p>You are not alone. Over the past several years, <span="highlight">I’ve helped millions of people answer those questions and travel more with tested and proven tips and advice.</span> This way, you can spend less time searching the Internet and being overwhelmed with information and more time doing the one thing you want to do: travel more.</p>

      <h2>WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY</h2>
      <p>What separates this website from other travel blogs? Unlike other travel websites, you won’t find sponsored content or paid trips here. Every place, restaurant, or attractions has been personally visited by me (or one of my guest columnists) and we pay our own way. <span="highlight">We sleep in dorms and budget hotels, wait hours for buses, try those roadside street stalls, and test travel passes to see if they really do save money.</span> We do it just like you would – because, like you, we’re real travelers looking to see the world and help others do the same.</p>
